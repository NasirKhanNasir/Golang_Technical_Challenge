# Golang_Technical_Challenge

since it was a web-application so i have completed it using console output, one could design a GUI and other HTML/CSS/bootstrap design but that was not the requirement.

Step by Step procedure for the task solution

To check which ever link one want to test just add it in the:


func main()                //area             i.e.  espncricinfo.com       etc
{
      //i.e. here i have used espncricinfo website, in the main code i used golang.org site.
	blogTitles, err := GetLatestBlogTitles("https://golang.org/")

//there are multiple approach one can take value from user using scanner  Scanln(&first)  but i think it is easy to just write it here.





# golang workplace must be set up (proper IDE and Go lang installation)
# using powershell
# run the following commands
# go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery         (git // "golang.org/x/net/html")
# go run scrapper.go


//note: there may be some respositories issues and some enviornment variables issues, so all of the workspace must be completely set in order to let the applicattion proper work.


/*since the logic for the form i used is to get the field of password and detect on it that whether a site use a password field or not, it may vary for site to site,. because somesites like facebook don't use the name of password field as "password" in the sign up page so that form would appear as No-login form. in order to achieve that we have to manullay select that login field and check the variable name. */
