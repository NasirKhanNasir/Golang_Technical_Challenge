# Golang_Technical_Challenge

since it was a web-application so i have completed it using console output, one could design a GUI and other HTML/CSS/bootstrap design but that was not the requirement.

Step by Step procedure for the task solution

To check which ever link one want to test just add it in the:


func main()                //area
{
      //i.e. here i have used espncricinfo website, in the main code i used golang.org site.
	blogTitles, err := GetLatestBlogTitles("https://www.espncricinfo.com/")

//there are multiple approach one can take value from user using scanner  Scanln(&first)  but i think it is easy to just write it here.





# golang workplace must be set up (proper IDE and Go lang installation)
# using powershell
# run the following commands
# go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery         (git // "golang.org/x/net/html")
# go run scrapper.go


//note: there may be some respositories issues and some enviornment variables issues, so all of the workspace must be completely set in order to let the applicattion proper work.
